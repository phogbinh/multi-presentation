  \begin{itemize}
    \item Homogeneous base stations, mmWave, downlink transmission, OFDMA, multiple-input eMBB and single-input URLLC users.
    \item Saturated eMBB traffic \cite{S05}: Each eMBB user has \highlight{infinite} amount of data to be served.
    \item Strict URLLC constraint: Each URLLC has an amount of data required to be served within a minislot.
    \item The system aims to maximize eMBB total average rate and fairness while satisfying URLLC demands.

\subsection{Multicell Co-channel Intereference}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Multicell Co-channel Interference}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Since the base stations are homogeneous i.e. use the same frequency band, there exists 3 types of interference:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item eMBB-eMBB inteference e.g. at subchannel $3$, signal from base station $0$ to eMBB user $0$ interferes with that from base station $1$ to eMBB user $1$.
        \item eMBB-URLLC interference e.g. at subchannel $0$, signal from base station $0$ to eMBB user $0$ interferes with that from base station $2$ to URLLC user $1$.
        \item URLLC-URLLC interference e.g. at subchannel $4$, signal from base station $1$ to URLLC user $0$ interferes with that from base station $2$ to URLLC user $1$.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A viable solution might be 5G Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) with Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC). % TODO example
    \item Inspired by Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), a modified Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) scheme is proposed to tackle the problem\exampleFootnote.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our scheme works well with the often small number of base stations.
    \item Our scheme encompasses URLLC \highlight{multiconnectivity} via joint transmission.
    \item This hence introduces a joint CDMA/OFDMA scheme.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Spectrum Inefficiency}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Spectrum Inefficiency}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Dedicated URLLC bandwidth wastes spectral resources significantly in multicell systems.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item If $2$ subchannels of each base station are dedicated to URLLC traffic, then we would have $6$ subchannels sitting \highlight{idle for most of the time} in the aforementioned scenario.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This problem can be addressed by leveraging URLLC superposition/puncturing scheme. % TODO citations
    \item URLLC superposition scheme employs 5G NOMA SIC, whose performance equals to puncturing when the considered eMBB and URLLC users have the same channel gain. % TODO citations and example
    \item URLLC puncturing scheme is discussed here.
